# odin-recipes
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and aims to create a website of food recipes in order to improve my web development skills. In this project I'm supposed to test my HTML knowledge by doing: boilerplate HTML, headings, paragraphs, emphasizing, ordered and unordered lists, links and images.
